```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ran_sample = rnorm(8)
vec_logic = ifelse(ran_sample > 0, TRUE, FALSE)
vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H")
vec_factor = factor(c("low", "low", "medium", "medium", "high", "high", "low", "high"))

question_1_df = tibble(
  ran_sample,
  vec_logic,
  vec_char,
  vec_factor
)

mean(ran_sample)
mean(vec_logic)
mean(vec_char)
mean(vec_factor)
```
We only succeed in taking the mean of ran_sample which is numeric and vec_logic which is logical vector. It doesn't work for character and factor vector to take means.

```{r echo = TRUE, results= "hide"}
as.numeric(vec_logic)
as.numeric(vec_char)
as.numeric(vec_factor)
```
